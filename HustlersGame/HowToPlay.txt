Welcome street kid, Step into Night City, a neon-lit battleground where survival means stacking eddies. 
As a street kid, your mission is clear: hustle your way to the elusive Hustler's Market, navigating trades at locations nearby, 
Neighbor and your House. But watch your wallet... hit zero, and it's game over. In this cyberpunk labyrinth, every deal, every implant, and every move counts. 
Welcome to the concrete jungle... your journey starts now.

Here in Night City, everybody is chomping at your eddies.... so you will notice travel cost is doubled, and everybody is trying to rip you off!
